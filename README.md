## Abstract
Being able to better understand the drug epidemic that has ripped across our country may help save the lives of those who are syffering from drug addiction. I chose to use age as the target variable in this project. Being able to target individuals of specific ages may allow us the create programs for that specific age range and possibly save lives. I created several visualizations, hypothesis tests and models to show the data. Ultimately, the OLS model performed best, outperforming the LassoLars, TweedieRegressor and the baseline models.
